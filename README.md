# fire_app

A new Flutter project.

## Future Fixes

1. The screen does not stretch all the way to the bottom. Not sure if it's a configuration issue or what
2. Crew Members and gear need a unique ID (for Trip Preferences). If they are deleted, any Trip Preferences need to be scanned and updated.
3. Need to think about how user's updated data affects Trip Preferences
4. Positional/Gear Preference Data reflection upon editing/deleting main objects. Needs to scan
5. Enable Global tool creation, e.g., P-tool, Chainsaw, Dolmar, etc.
